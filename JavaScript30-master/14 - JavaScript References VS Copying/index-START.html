    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // This is not a copy, it's a reference to the original array
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    /*
    team[3] = 'Lux';  // This line updates both the arrays
    console.log(players, team);
    */
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!  
    const team2 = players.slice();  // one way
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [...players]  // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team5 = Array.from(players);  // or use Array.from

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'hello world!';
    console.log(team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // This is only a reference to person
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 }); // This is a shallow copy
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
